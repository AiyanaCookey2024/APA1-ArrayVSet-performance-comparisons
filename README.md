# Learning Objectives:

## Before starting ðŸ“’

Have a look at the operation of sets and arrays in `1Arrays101.js` and `2Sets101.js`. These are meant to be a quick overview demonstrating basic features.

## Experiment Steps - for each `testX.js` :

* Read the code with a partner and make sure you understand what it's achieving.
* Run the code multiple times
* Modify dataset size
* Compare performance metrics
* Discuss why performance varies

## Demonstrate performance differences between arrays and sets.

1. Understand time complexity of `includes()` vs `has()` using `test1.js`
1. Understand space complexity differences between and array and set using `test2.js`

1. Visualise performance penalties for large datasets



Discussion Points:

Time complexity of array includes() (O(n))
Set has() method efficiency (O(1))
Memory usage differences
Practical implications for large-scale applications
